abstract = {Stream-learn is a Python package compatible with scikit-learn and developed for the drifting and imbalanced data stream analysis. Its main component is a stream generator, which allows producing a synthetic data stream that may incorporate each of the three main concept drift types (i.e., sudden, gradual and incremental drift) in their recurring or non-recurring version, as well as static and dynamic class imbalance. The package allows conducting experiments following established evaluation methodologies (i.e., Test-Then-Train and Prequential). Besides, estimators adapted for data stream classification have been implemented, including both simple classifiers and state-of-the-art chunk-based and online classifier ensembles. The package utilises its own implementations of prediction metrics for imbalanced binary classification tasks to improve computational efficiency.}

	abstract = {Fake news has now grown into a big problem for societies and also a major challenge for people fighting disinformation. This phenomenon plagues democratic elections, reputations of individual persons or organizations, and has negatively impacted citizens, (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US or Brazil). Hence, developing effective tools to fight this phenomenon by employing advanced Machine Learning (ML) methods poses a significant challenge. The following paper displays the present body of knowledge on the application of such intelligent tools in the fight against disinformation. It starts by showing the historical perspective and the current role of fake news in the information war. Proposed solutions based solely on the work of experts are analysed and the most important directions of the application of intelligent systems in the detection of misinformation sources are pointed out. Additionally, the paper presents some useful resources (mainly datasets useful when assessing ML solutions for fake news detection) and provides a short overview of the most important R&D projects related to this subject. The main purpose of this work is to analyse the current state of knowledge in detecting fake news; on the one hand to show possible solutions, and on the other hand to identify the main challenges and methodological gaps to motivate future research.},

@article{Sta21,
	abstract = {Many researchers working on classification problems evaluate the quality of developed algorithms based on computer experiments. The conclusions drawn from them are usually supported by the statistical analysis and chosen experimental protocol. Statistical tests are widely used to confirm whether considered methods significantly outperform reference classifiers. Usually, the tests are applied to stratified datasets, which could raise the question of whether data folds used for classification are really randomly drawn and how the statistical analysis supports robust conclusions. Unfortunately, some scientists do not realize the real meaning of the obtained results and overinterpret them. They do not see that inappropriate use of such analytical tools may lead them into a trap. This paper aims to show the commonly used experimental protocols' weaknesses and discuss if we really can trust in such evaluation methodology, if all presented evaluations are fair and if it is possible to manipulate the experimental results using well-known statistical evaluation methods. We will present that it is possible to choose only such results, confirming the experimenter's expectation. We will try to show what could be done to avoid such likely unethical behavior. At the end of this work, we will formulate recommendations on improving an experimental protocol to design fair experimental classifier evaluation.},
